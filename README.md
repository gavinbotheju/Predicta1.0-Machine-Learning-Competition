Predicta 1.0: Weather Prediction and Classification

Welcome to the Predicta 1.0 competition repository! This repository contains solutions for two critical tasks aimed at enhancing weather forecasting and classification, which are essential for multiple sectors, including agriculture, disaster management, energy management, and transportation.

Task 1: Predicting Weather Data Accurate weather predictions are crucial for numerous aspects of life and industry. They help farmers optimize crop yields, aid disaster preparedness and response, enhance energy management, and ensure the safety and efficiency of transportation systems. Reliable weather forecasts also support public health by anticipating extreme conditions and assist individuals in daily planning. By predicting weather data, we can make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and improve the overall quality of life.
